SpreeLastAddress
================

Relieves the customer of typing his address again on a second order. (As this unnecessary typing may lead to order abortion)

Prefills any address during checkout with the last used address.


No db changes, one query during checkout more.

PS: The bizzare ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch error has hit me and so this currently only works with config.cache_classes = true  , set also in development. (There seems to be a hidden class loading issue somewhere)
